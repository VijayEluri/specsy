	RELEASING

1. Run the following commands:

    ./scripts/release-all.sh
    git push
    git push --tags

2. Release the staging repository through https://oss.sonatype.org/

3. Update the version history on the web site

4. Wait for the release to show up in Maven Central

5. Announce to specsy@googlegroups.com, implicitly@posterous.com, scala-announce@googlegroups.com


	RELEASING A SINGLE MODULE

NOTE: Since Scala 2.10 sbt's naming convention [1] doesn't anymore use the
full version number, so it shouldn't anymore be necessary to release a
single module like this. For more information, see
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Detailed-Topics/Cross-Build.html#publishing-conventions

Releasing a module for a new language version:

1. Checkout a branch from the original release's tag

    git checkout -b v2.1.x v2.1.0

2. Edit specsy-scala_2.9/pom.xml and change the scala.version property to "2.9.3"

3. Commit as "Release for Scala 2.9.3", but do NOT create a tag

    git commit -am "Release for Scala 2.9.3"
    git push origin HEAD

4. Deploy only that module

    cd specsy-scala_2.9
    ../scripts/stage.sh   "`git log --format=format:%s -1`"
    ../scripts/publish.sh "`git log --format=format:%s -1`"

5. Release the staging repository through https://oss.sonatype.org/
