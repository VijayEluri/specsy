You can download Specsy from the [Maven Central Repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/orfjackal/specsy/specsy/). The source code is at <https://github.com/orfjackal/specsy>

If you use Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.orfjackal.specsy</groupId>
        <artifactId>specsy</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

The default artifact is compiled using Scala 2.9.0. If you are using Scala 2.8.1, add the `scala281` classifier to your dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.orfjackal.specsy</groupId>
        <artifactId>specsy</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
        <classifier>scala281</classifier>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

Continue to the [documentation](documentation.html) to find out how to use Specsy.


Version History
---------------

**2.0.0 (Coming Soon!)**

- Runs using the [Jumi](http://jumi.fi/) test runner, fixing all previously known issues (e.g. it now runs tests in parallel and reports test execution in real time)
- Rewrote the core in Java to support multiple programming languages through thin language-specific frontends
- Supports Scala, version 2.7.7 upwards
- Supports Groovy, all versions
- Supports Java, version 7 upwards (lambdas are recommended for more tolerable syntax noise)

**1.2.0 (2011-05-17)**

- Fixed the order of tests in JUnit results
- Added `shareSideEffects()` for a non-isolated execution model
- Added Scaladocs for the methods in `Spec`
- Compiled with Scala 2.9.0 and 2.8.1

**1.1.0 (2011-05-13)**

- Made the `Spec.defer` method public, to allow it to be used from helper classes
- Renamed the implicit `Spec.specify` method for declaring nested specs, to avoid potential name clashes
- Execute child specs in the same order as they are declared (when single-threaded)
- Made output capturing disabled by default. Use the JVM option `-Dspecsy.captureOutput=true` to enable it
- Upgraded to Scala 2.9.0

**1.0.1 (2010-08-29)**

- Fixed Scala's `println()` not being captured, due to `scala.Console` being unaffected by `java.lang.System.setOut()`

**1.0.0 (2010-08-16)**

- Isolated execution model
- Unlimited nested specs
- Defer blocks
- JUnit test runner
